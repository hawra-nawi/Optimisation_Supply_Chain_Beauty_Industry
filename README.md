# Optimisation Supply Chain in the Beauty Industry

This project explores strategies to address rising manufacturing costs in the beauty industry, with a specific focus on [Huda Beauty](https://hudabeauty.com/uk/en_GB/home). The presentation highlights the following key points:

1. The **growing challenge of escalating raw material costs** in beauty manufacturing, increased by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation, and supply chain disruptions.
2. An **analysis of supply chain disruptions**, comparing pre-COVID and post-COVID scenarios across various factors like raw material availability, pricing, and geopolitical impacts.
3. A **case study of a Huda Beauty product**, proposing an optimized ingredient composition to reduce costs while maintaining product quality.
4. **Benefits of the proposed solution**, including cost savings, improved supply chain resilience, and potential sustainability improvements.
5. **Considerations for implementing changes**, such as ensuring product quality, regulatory compliance, and managing consumer perceptions.
6. **Alternative strategies for managing costs** when expensive ingredients are essential, including bulk purchasing, long-term contracts, formulation innovation, alternative sourcing, and the use of AI and IoT technologies in manufacturing and other departments.

The project demonstrates a [data-driven approach](https://github.com/hawra-nawi/Optimisation_Supply_Chain_Beauty_Industry/blob/main/data_analysis_product_composition.py) to addressing manufacturing cost challenges in the beauty industry, offering practical solutions that balance cost-effectiveness with product quality and consumer satisfaction. Python was leveraged to create a detailed case study of a Huda Beauty product, enabling:

1. **Ingredient composition analysis**: Python scripts were used to break down the product formula and calculate the percentage of each ingredient.
2. **Cost optimisation modeling**: The project utilised Python to model various ingredient combinations, optimising for cost while maintaining product efficacy.
3. **Data visualisation**: Python libraries were employed to create clear, informative visualisations of the original and optimised formulas, as well as their associated costs.
4. **Scenario analysis**: Python allowed for quick iteration of different cost scenarios, helping to identify the most promising cost-saving opportunities.

By utilising Python, the project was able to process complex data efficiently, providing a robust foundation for the proposed manufacturing cost reduction strategies.
