# Optimisation Supply Chain in the Beauty Industry

This project explores strategies to address rising manufacturing costs in the beauty industry, with a specific focus on Huda Beauty. The presentation highlights the following key points:

1. The growing challenge of escalating raw material costs in beauty manufacturing, exacerbated by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, global inflation, and supply chain disruptions.
2. An analysis of supply chain disruptions, comparing pre-COVID and post-COVID scenarios across various factors like raw material availability, pricing, and geopolitical impacts.
3. A case study of a Huda Beauty product, proposing an optimized ingredient composition to reduce costs while maintaining product quality.
4. Benefits of the proposed solution, including cost savings, improved supply chain resilience, and potential sustainability improvements.
5. Considerations for implementing changes, such as ensuring product quality, regulatory compliance, and managing consumer perceptions.
6. Alternative strategies for managing costs when expensive ingredients are essential, including bulk purchasing, long-term contracts, formulation innovation, alternative sourcing, and the use of AI and IoT technologies in manufacturing and other departments.

The project demonstrates a data-driven approach to addressing manufacturing cost challenges in the beauty industry, offering practical solutions that balance cost-effectiveness with product quality and consumer satisfaction.
